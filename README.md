# Trading212 Trading Instruments Scraper

A simple webscraper using selenium and beautiful soup to produce a list of all avaible stocks, ETFs and other instruments available with trading212 invest
The idea is to then expand this project to generate a list of these instruments and include metrics such as P/E, current price etc. via another API.

Might also be a nice web dev project to display these instruments and metrics on a page somewhere.
